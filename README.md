# Chatbot project

You should first create an API key in OpenAI and make sure you have enough credits to consume OpenAI tokens.

You should first add your OpenAI secret key to an environment variable, for example:

```export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>```

Then, in order to run the application, it is recommended for you to create a virtual environment by issuing the following commands:

```python3 -m venv venv```

```source venv/bin/activate```

Then, you should install the dependencies of the project with:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Finally, you can start the development application server with:

```python backend.py```
